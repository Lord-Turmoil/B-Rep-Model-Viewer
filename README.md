## How to build?

It is developed with C# WPF and .NET 6 in Visual Studio 2022 Community. So you just need to open the `.sln`, then build and run.

The working directory of the project is set to `Work\` directory under the project root folder. And it contains 3 sample models - `Cube.json`, `Rectangular Pyramid.json` and `Stair.json`.

---

## Limitations

- Cannot handle models with holes
- In theory, can only handle convex polyhedron. Simple concave polyhedron (such as the `Stair.json`) can be created with delicately constructed data
- When Muti-color enabled, there may be rendering error in certain view angle caused by the failure of Z-Test
